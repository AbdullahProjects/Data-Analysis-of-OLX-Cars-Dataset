# Data Analysis of OLX-Cars Dataset

Welcome to the project of Data Analysis of OLX Cars Dataset. This project is designed to get useful insights from dataset. The [OLX Cars dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahkhanuet22/olx-cars-dataset) is avaiable on Kaggle, I personally scraped it using BeautifulSoup and Requests Libraries in Python. 

## Live Demo:

## About this Project:

### Motivation:

Today each company or business generating whole amount of data whether from its services or from products. These companies want to grow their income and profit. That's why they need suggestions to do something that will really benefit their company revenues. These suggestions can only get from hidden patterns of data. Data Analytics demand is growing day by day. Also, for building Machine Learning Models, it is important to first analyze the data that help us to find and remove unnecessary columns or rows for enhancing the performance of Model.

### Dataset I used?

[OLX Cars dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahkhanuet22/olx-cars-dataset): Contains 9000+ records of used cars in Pakistan that owners want to sale.

### Project Development Steps:

1. **Download Dataset:** Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Perform Analysis on Jupyter Notebook:** I first try to analyze roughly on Jupyter Notebook, then create Streamlit Webapp for better user interctions.
3. **Analyzing Dataset into 3 categories:** This step helps to analyze data more effeciently.
   - **Step 1:** Overall Analysis
   - **Step 2:** Brands-wise Analysis
   - **Step 3:** Model-wise Analysis
   - **Step 4:** City-wise Analysis
4. **Create Streamlit Webapp:** After analyzing whole dataset, finally I create Streamlit Webapp for better user interactions.
